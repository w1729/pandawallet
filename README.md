# PANDA WALLET (click->click->click->your gateway to blockchain is ready)

The Panda wallet simplifies the user onboarding experience through a smooth one-click process. Leveraging the functionalities of account abstraction and passkeys, users can easily generate passkey credentials, set up a smart account, and deploy—all with just a single click on their smartphone or computer. The wallet operates discreetly, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience for users.

# Motivation

Blockchain is a transformative technology capable of addressing numerous societal challenges, with applications spanning across various sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, healthcare, and more. However, for an average user without extensive technical knowledge, navigating the blockchain landscape can be overwhelming, involving terms like wallet, private key, gas fees, secure private key, and others. Onboarding becomes a substantial hurdle for the ordinary user.

# Objective of Panda Wallet

Panda Wallet aims to address challenges through the integration of account abstraction and passkeys. This approach ensures a seamless onboarding experience for users with just a single click on their smartphone or laptop. Users can effortlessly generate passkey credentials and set up their smart accounts, streamlining the process for enhanced user convenience.

# Details

## UX OPTIMIZATION

Panda Wallet offers an optimal user experience with seamless one-click onboarding. This optimization is chosen to alleviate user concerns, as there is no need to worry about saving private key – all information is securely stored on the client's system.

## passkey implementation

Currently, the implementation of passkey-powered user operations involves the utilization of the secpR1 library from FCL. The system comprises an entrypoint contract and a custom paymaster contract designed to handle user fees. This configuration enables more individuals to easily access the realm of cryptocurrency.

## what about security?

Passkeys represent a contemporary evolution in Web2 security, poised to supplant traditional password management and its associated risks with robust ECC authentication, serving as an EoA. This transformative shift is facilitated through ERC-4337, promising to revolutionize accessibility and inclusivity in the realm of web3. Passkeys introduce a novel approach where the private key is securely stored in a hardened enclave, resilient against advanced attacks. This contrasts with keys stored in browsers, providing a heightened level of security. Additionally, passkeys mitigate phishing risks by linking them to a specific website, such as the dApp's site.

Step 3: **In this step, users are prompted to undergo biometric verification, with options such as Face ID and Touch ID currently available. The system is designed to accommodate additional biometric methods, such as voice recognition, in the future. The provided credentials are utilized to derive the public key used in ERC-4337**

Step 4: **After providing the biometric verification, the credential details are securely saved in the local system. Users will be prompted to grant permission for this process, which can be conveniently done using either a mobile or laptop. The system ensures a seamless experience, with the permission prompt triggered automatically, requiring no additional action from the user.**

# implementation details

**Off-chain Smartphone Signer:**

Upon initiating the "create account" process, our system employs a sophisticated off-chain smartphone signer. This signer generates a secure passkey by utilizing the biometric identification capabilities of the smartphone. Importantly, the FIDO passkey is securely stored within the smartphone's enclave, offering a formidable defense against potential phishing attempts. This is a notable improvement over conventional practices that store private keys in less secure memory zones, such as those within browsers. The resulting public key, derived from the passkey credential, is then transmitted to the main contract on the blockchain. Subsequent transactions within the system are authenticated using this passkey, enhancing security through biometric identification and decentralized passkey management.

**On-chain Transaction:**

Within the on-chain transaction process, the JavaScript front-end application facilitates the transmission of an authenticator challenge to the secure enclave of the smartphone. This method ensures a secure and reliable initiation and validation of transactions directly on the blockchain. The on-chain transaction mechanism introduces an additional layer of security and transparency to the overall system, bolstering the reliability of transaction processing.

# installation setup

The current implementation implementation seamlessly integrates with the Infinitism ERC4337 Entrypoint and a customized PayMaster. This integration facilitates the effortless payment of user fees, ensuring accessibility for users of all expertise levels.

#### Deploy contracts

```bash
forge script script/DeployAllAnvil.s.sol --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast -vvv --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

To execute the PayMaster, Bundler, and Frontend components, Docker containers would be utilized. This approach ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for running these elements, streamlining deployment and management across various systems.

webAuthAccount contracts control the passkey authentication.
